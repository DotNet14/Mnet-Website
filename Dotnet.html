          <h3>C#</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="slide2">
          <p>C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft as
            part of
            its .NET framework. Introduced in 2000, it has since become one of the most widely used
            languages for
            developing desktop applications, web services, and even mobile applications. Key features of C#
            include:
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong> C# follows the principles of OOP, such as
              encapsulation,
              inheritance, and polymorphism, making code modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.</li>
            <li><strong>Type Safety:</strong> As a strongly typed language, C# requires variables to be declared with a
              specific data
              type, reducing runtime errors.</li>
            <li><strong>Automatic Garbage Collection:</strong> The .NET runtime handles memory management by
              automatically
              freeing
              unused objects, which improves performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> C# can work seamlessly with other languages supported by the .NET
              framework, such
              as VB.NET and F#.</li>
            <li><strong>Multithreading and Asynchronous Programming:</strong> C# offers built-in support for concurrent
              execution
              through asynchronous programming (using the <code>async</code> and <code>await</code>
              keywords).</li>
            <li><strong>Platform Independence:</strong> C# applications can run on Windows, Linux, and macOS using .NET
              Core.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Rich Libraries and Frameworks:</strong> Developers can leverage various built-in libraries for
              tasks
              like file
              handling, database access, networking, and GUI development.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Code Development:</strong> C# enforces type safety and provides security mechanisms to
              prevent
              common
              vulnerabilities like buffer overflows.</li>

          <h3>Asp.Net(MVC)</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="slide2">
          <p>ASP.NET MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a framework developed by Microsoft for building web
            applications
            using a structured design pattern. Unlike traditional Web Forms, MVC provides better separation of
            concerns, making applications more manageable, scalable, and testable. Key concepts of ASP.NET MVC
            include:
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture:</strong> This includes the <strong>Model</strong>,
              which
              represents the applicationâ€™s data and business logic; the <strong>View</strong>, which handles
              the UI and presentation logic; and the <strong>Controller</strong>, which processes user input
              and updates the model and view.</li>
            <li><strong>Routing System:</strong> ASP.NET MVC employs a powerful routing mechanism to define how URLs map
              to
              controller
              actions, making web applications more user-friendly and SEO-friendly.</li>
            <li><strong>Dependency Injection (DI):</strong> This enables better management of dependencies and promotes
              a
              loosely
              coupled design.</li>
            <li><strong>Filters:</strong> These provide mechanisms to add cross-cutting concerns like authentication,
              authorization,
              and logging.</li>
            <li><strong>View Engines:</strong> Razor is the most commonly used view engine in ASP.NET MVC, allowing
              embedded
              C# code
              within HTML views.</li>
          </ol>

        <div class="slide2">
          <p>ADO.NET (ActiveX Data Objects for .NET) is a data access technology from Microsoft that provides the
            ability
            to connect to, retrieve, manipulate, and update data from various sources such as SQL Server,
            Oracle,
            MySQL, and other databases. As part of the .NET framework, it is designed for efficient data handling
            in web
            and desktop applications. Key components of ADO.NET include:
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Connection Object:</strong> Establishes a connection to a database.</li>
            <li><strong>Command Object:</strong> Used to execute SQL queries and stored procedures.</li>
            <li><strong>DataReader:</strong> A fast, forward-only method to read data from a database.</li>
            <li><strong>DataAdapter:</strong> Facilitates communication between a database and a dataset.</li>
            <li><strong>DataSet:</strong> Stores data retrieved from a database and allows disconnected operations.</li>

          <p>Entity Framework (EF) is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework developed by Microsoft that
            simplifies
            database interactions in .NET applications. It allows developers to work with databases using C#
            objects
            rather than writing complex SQL queries. Key features of Entity Framework include:
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):</strong> Maps database tables to C# classes for easier data
              handling.
            </li>
            <li><strong>LINQ Integration:</strong> Enables writing queries in C# instead of SQL.</li>
            <li><strong>Automatic Change Tracking:</strong> Tracks modifications to objects and updates the database
              accordingly.</li>
            <li><strong>Migration Support:</strong> Facilitates database versioning and updates without manual SQL
              scripts.</li>
            <li><strong>Lazy Loading & Eager Loading:</strong> Controls how data is loaded for performance optimization.

        <div class="slide2">
          <p>Layered architecture is a design pattern used to organize code into logical layers, making
            applications more
            scalable, maintainable, and modular. Each layer has a specific role and interacts only with adjacent
            layers. Typical layers in an application include:
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Presentation Layer (UI Layer):</strong> Handles user interface and interactions
              (e.g., web pages, mobile app screens, desktop UI) and uses technologies like ASP.NET MVC,
              React, and Angular.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Logic Layer (BLL):</strong> Contains business rules and calculations, acting
              as a
              bridge between the UI and data (e.g., validating user inputs, applying pricing rules).</li>
            <li><strong>Data Access Layer (DAL):</strong> Handles communication with the database (e.g.,
              fetching user
              data from a SQL database) and uses technologies like ADO.NET, Entity Framework, and Dapper.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Database Layer:</strong> Stores and retrieves data efficiently (e.g., SQL Server,
              MySQL,
              PostgreSQL).</li>

          <p>MVC is a design pattern that helps organize code in web applications by separating
            responsibilities into
            three distinct parts:
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Model (Data Layer):</strong> Represents the application's data and business logic,
              interacting with the database and processing information.</li>
            <li><strong>View (User Interface Layer):</strong> Is responsible for displaying data to the user,
              typically as an HTML page with embedded C# code using Razor syntax.</li>
            <li><strong>Controller (Logic & Routing Layer):</strong> Manages requests, processes data, and
              returns
              responses to the user, acting as the bridge between the Model and View.</li>
